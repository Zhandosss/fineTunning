Different parameters passed to the same endpoint might contribute to a different amount of resource consumption.\nFurthermore, some requests may trigger lengthy background processes that are also considered in the throttling evaluation algorithm.\nTherefore, the rate of requests can not be described as simple numbers of requests in a certain period of time. Throttling policies are based on historical daily request data, including legitimate usages that stress the system.\nCustomers can be assured that the Acrobat Sign policies are generous enough that regular daily workflow volume will not be affected.\""}
